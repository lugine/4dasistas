# Agent Coordination — READ BEFORE EDITING

This repo is edited by multiple AI agents (Claude in chat, Kilo in VS Code,
and a scheduled Claude Cowork task) plus Lujane directly. To avoid silent
conflicts, every agent — regardless of which tool it is — follows this
protocol.

## Before you touch anything

1. **Pull `main` fresh.** Never work from a copy fetched earlier in your
   own session — another agent may have committed since then.
2. **Read the "Current Status" section below.** If another agent shows
   `IN PROGRESS` on a file you need to touch, stop and flag it to Lujane
   instead of editing anyway.
3. **Update "Current Status" to declare yourself IN PROGRESS** before you
   start editing, listing exactly which files.

## While working

- Keep changes small and scoped to the actual task. Don't refactor,
  rename, or restructure things that weren't asked for.
- Don't touch another agent's in-progress files.
- Test before committing (JSON validity, JS syntax, YAML validity —
  whichever applies).

## After committing

- Update "Current Status" back to `IDLE`.
- Add one line to the "Recent Activity Log" below: date, agent, files,
  one-line summary. Keep the last ~15 entries; trim older ones.
- Report to Lujane: files changed, commit SHA, what you tested, anything
  left open.

## Known regular actors

- **Claude (chat)** — primary builder, holds a GitHub PAT scoped to this
  repo, pushes via the GitHub API directly.
- **Kilo (VS Code)** — edits locally via Lujane's own git credentials.
- **Claude Cowork (scheduled task)** — runs on a timer, only ever touches
  `data/sports.json`, `data/gatherings.json`, `data/organizations.json`,
  `data/resources.json`. Never touches `index.html`, `admin/`, or
  `calendar.ics`. If you see unfamiliar entries in those 4 files, that's
  almost certainly this task, not a bug.
